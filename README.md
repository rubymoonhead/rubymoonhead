- ðŸ‘‹ Hi!
- ðŸ‘€ I develop sites using the latest versions of HTML, CSS, and basic JS (only what's necessary to make certain featurs on my website work, i.e., nav buttons).
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently: (1) developing responsive single page websites; (2) writing a blog post with Markdown; (3) developing a Hugo blog WIP.
